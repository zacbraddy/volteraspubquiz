# Title: Linting and Toolchain Selection

## Context and Problem Statement
The project requires a production-ready development environment with robust linting and code quality tooling for both JavaScript/TypeScript and Python codebases. The goal was to establish a reliable and efficient development workflow.

## Decision Drivers
- Need for production-ready tooling
- Multi-language support (JavaScript/TypeScript and Python)
- Time constraints of the project
- Developer experience requirements
- Previous experience with tooling combinations

## Considered Options
Prior investigation in recent projects had already established an effective toolchain, so no new alternatives were evaluated for this project. The established toolset includes:

Frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript):
- ESLint with multiple plugins
- Prettier
- TypeScript type checking

Backend (Python):
- Black
- Flake8
- isort

## Decision Outcome
Implemented the previously established toolchain configuration, leveraging proven practices from recent projects.

## Consequences

### Good
- Production-ready development environment out of the box
- Well-understood tooling configuration
- Proven effectiveness from previous projects
- Time savings from reusing established patterns
- Strong type checking with TypeScript
- Consistent code formatting across the codebase
- Comprehensive linting coverage

### Bad
- May miss opportunities for newer/better tools
- Limited exploration of alternatives
- Possible over-configuration with numerous ESLint plugins
- Some tool configurations may need adjustment for project-specific needs

## More Information
The decision to reuse this established toolchain was primarily driven by the proven effectiveness in recent projects and the time efficiency gained from leveraging existing knowledge and configurations.
