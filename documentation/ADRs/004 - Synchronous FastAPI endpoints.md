# Title: Synchronous FastAPI Endpoints with SQLAlchemy

## Context and Problem Statement

As the sole developer on this project, I need to decide whether FastAPI endpoints should be declared as `async` when they use SQLAlchemy database operations. The application uses synchronous SQLAlchemy operations throughout the repository layer, and I have a maximum of 4 hours to complete the implementation.

This decision impacts:
- Development velocity within the tight timeline
- Code complexity and maintainability for this application scale
- Performance characteristics for the expected load
- Consistency of architectural patterns throughout the codebase

## Decision Drivers

- **Time Constraint**: 4-hour maximum development window requires pragmatic choices
- **Application Scale**: Small application scope with limited concurrent users expected
- **Solo Development**: As the only team member, simplicity reduces implementation risk
- **Consistency**: Maintaining uniform patterns throughout the codebase
- **Performance Requirements**: Expected load doesn't justify async complexity
- **Pragmatic Engineering**: Choosing appropriate technology for the actual problem size

## Considered Options

- **Option 1**: Keep endpoints synchronous when using synchronous SQLAlchemy
- **Option 2**: Make endpoints async and use async SQLAlchemy throughout
- **Option 3**: Mixed async/sync approach

## Decision Outcome

**Synchronous FastAPI endpoints with synchronous SQLAlchemy**

I will use entirely synchronous FastAPI endpoints with synchronous SQLAlchemy operations throughout the repository layer.

## Consequences

### Good
- **Faster Implementation**: No need to refactor existing sync SQLAlchemy code to async patterns
- **Simpler Codebase**: Consistent synchronous pattern throughout the entire application
- **Appropriate for Scale**: Perfectly reasonable and performant for this application's expected usage
- **Reduced Complexity**: No async/await debugging or event loop considerations to manage
- **Clear Architecture**: Straightforward request → service → repository → database flow
- **Lower Risk**: As a solo developer, fewer potential points of failure during tight timeline

### Bad
- **Limited Concurrency**: Requests will block on database operations
- **Future Scaling**: Would require refactoring if the application needed to handle high concurrency
- **Not Future-Proofed**: Missing opportunity to build with async patterns from the start

## More Information

This decision prioritizes delivery within the time constraint while maintaining code quality. For this application's scale and expected usage patterns, synchronous SQLAlchemy with FastAPI provides adequate performance without the additional complexity overhead that async patterns would introduce.
